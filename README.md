# React Fire example

React with Firebase Login.

To get the sample up and running, you need to do the following:-
  - Clone the repo
  - Install the latest Node
  - Install NPM

```npm install```

To run the dev environment use:

```npm start```

and to create a static (prod) build use:

```npm run build```

This project uses [Quick React Starter](https://github.com/jwarning/quick-react-starter.git) under the hood to manage all the build tooling.
